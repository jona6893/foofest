            At FooFest, we are committed to creating a sustainable and environmentally-friendly festival. To that end, we are proud to offer green camping options for our attendees. Our green camping options include solar-powered showers, compostable
            toilets, and solar-powered lighting. We also encourage campers to reduce their carbon footprint by bringing reusable water bottles and bags, and utilizing public transportation to get to the festival. With our green camping options, you
            can enjoy the festival while minimizing your impact on the environment.
