            At FooFest, we strive to create a sustainable and
            environmentally-friendly festival.
            <br />
            <br /> We aim to reduce our carbon footprint by utilizing renewable
            energy sources and recycling as much as possible. We also encourage
            attendees to bring their own reusable water bottles and bags, and to
            take advantage of public transportation to get to the festival.
            <br /> <br /> We are committed to creating a safe and fun experience
            for everyone while still being mindful of the environment.
